DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) is the protocol responsible for assigning IP addresses to newly connected devices

Enable Authoritative DHCP Server if it is the only DHCP server on your network (likely true for home use and small networks)

Enable DHCP Sequential IPs if you wish IPs to be assigned sequentially (e.g. 192.0.10.34, 192.0.10.35, etc.) instead of randomly.

Provide the IP Address for your preferred DNS server(s) here. 

Additional Info:
A DNS (Domain Name System) server is where website names (like www.example.com) get translated into IP addresses (like 127.0.0.1).

Reasons for changing this include running a custom local DNS server or using a DNS server that has less public traffic (possibly faster).  Make sure you only input valid DNS server IPs or traffic may not get resolved.
